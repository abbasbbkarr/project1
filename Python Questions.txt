1.What is init keyword ?

__init__ is a special method used for initializing newly created objects. 

2.What is self keyword ?

Self is a conventionally used parameter name in method definitions within a class. It 

3.What is lambda functon?

Lambda is a small anonymous function that can have any number of parameters, but can only have one expression.

4.Difference between lambda and normal function?

lambda functions are concise, anonymous functions used for simple operations, while normal functions are named, reusable blocks of code that can contain multiple statements and expressions.

5.What are generators? When to use ? share one example

Defined using functions along with the yield, Generators are particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or when you need to generate a sequence 

6.Python is compiled or interpreted language ? what does it mean?

 Interpreted language, meaning it's executed line by line by the Python interpreter at runtime

7.What is the difference between list and tuples in Python?

Use lists when you need a mutable collection of items, and use tuples when you need an immutable collection of items.

8.What is the difference between list and set in Python?

Use lists when you need to maintain order and allow duplicates, and use sets when you need to store unique elements or perform set operations.

9.When to use dictionary?

Dictionaries in Python are used to store collections of key-value pairs.

10.What are decorators? When to use ? share one example

Decorators are a powerful feature that allows you to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods without changing their code.

11.What are Iterators?

Iterators are used to iterate over a sequence of elements, allowing you to access each element one at a time.

12.What is slicing?

Slicing provides a convenient and efficient way to extract subsets of elements from sequences

13.What is mutable and immutable?

mutability and immutability in Python refer to whether the state of an object can be changed after it is created.

14.Python is single thread or multithread?

Supports both single-threaded and multithreaded programming.

15.What is GIL?

The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing.

16.What you donâ€™t like about python?

Sometimes its slow to run the program.

17.What is list Comprehension?

It allows you to construct a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable.

18.What are Dunder methods? Give examples

Dunder methods are used to implement functionality that is triggered by special syntax or operations
__init__(self, ...): The constructor method, called when an object is created. It initializes 

19.What does _init_ method do?

It is used to initialize the object's.

20.Difference between array and numpy library.

Both the array module and the numpy library provide functionality for working with arrays in Python, NumPy offers a more powerful and efficient solution.
